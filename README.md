# Repository for [Task Aware Modulation using Representation Learning: An Approach for Few Shot Learning in Environmental Systems]

This repository will host the code and additional resources for our paper, "[Task Aware Modulation using Representation Learning: An Approach for Few Shot Learning in Environmental Systems]" (TAM-RL) accepted at the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM25) and to appear in its proceedings.

We are currently in the process of organizing and preparing the code for release. The complete implementation and relevant scripts will be added here over the next couple of weeks.

Stay tuned, and feel free to star this repository for updates!
